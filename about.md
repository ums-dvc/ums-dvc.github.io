What is Hyperloop?

The Concepts

Hyperloop is a new paradigm of high-speed transportation envisioned by Elon Musk in 2013. With a projected top speed of 760 mph, the Hyperloop is poised to revolutionize transportation by moving passengers between cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco in as little as 35 minutes.

Hyperloop pods will travel in evacuated tubes above the ground, diminishing the drag force of atmospheric air and enabling passenger and freight transportation at high speeds with low energy consumption.
